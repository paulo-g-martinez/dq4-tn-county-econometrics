### **ACT's National "Achievement Gap" as a line plot.**
![ACT by Family Income](presentation/act_lineplot.png)

### **What is the "ACT Achievement Gap?"**
  In 2016 ACT [reported](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1604-ACT-Composite-Score-by-Family-Income.pdf) that **students, from families with an annual income of \$80,000 or more tend to score about four (4) points higher** than students in families that earn less than \$80,000 a year. 

*It's kindof a big deal*

[According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/weekly-earnings-by-educational-attainment-in-first-quarter-2016.htm) for 2016 just *going* to college boosted the average U.S. full-time worker's median **income from $679/week** to $782.
And *graduating with a bachelor's* boosted that up **to $1,155/week.** a difference of:

* $3,000/month vs $5,000/month
* **$36,000/year vs $60,000/year!** between holding a highschool diploma and bachelor's degree.


In 2013 the national average ACT composite score was 20.9. 

* With standardized-test scores like the SAT and **ACT** being a major (if not the primary) criteria for college admission in the US, **a four (4) point difference is a big difference!**

In 2014 similar results were [reported by the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/act-score-family-income_n_5600065.html) and [by the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/05/these-four-charts-show-how-the-sat-favors-the-rich-educated-families/?utm_term=.56cc245120db) about the ACT and the SAT respectively. And in September 2017, the Washington Post reported that the **Achievement Gap** has, if anything, *worsened* for the ACT: [*‘We didn’t know it was this bad’: New ACT scores show huge achievement gaps*.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/we-didnt-know-it-was-this-bad-new-act-scores-show-huge-achievement-gaps/2017/09/06/c6397f36-9279-11e7-aace-04b862b2b3f3_story.html?utm_term=.f50e950bb198)

### Correlation of a County's: AGIncome per Household vs ACT Composite
Notice that counties the ACT score distribution for each Income Segment.  

* Counties with "wealthier" household-income score no lower than 18.5 on the ACT.  

* Counties with "poorer" household-income score no higher than 19.5. (With the exception of trousdale which is on the "wealthier end of the poorest segment.")
